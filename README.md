## Usage

In order to generate a Cardano MAINNET payment signing key, use the following command:

```
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/geniusyield/signing-key-generator:latest
```

Payment signing keys for the PREPROD TESTNET can be generated by explicitly setting the NETWORK variable to TESTNET:

```
docker run -it -e NETWORK=testnet --rm ghcr.io/geniusyield/signing-key-generator:latest
```
